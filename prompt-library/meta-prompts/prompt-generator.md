## Objective

Generate a well-structured, effective prompt based on the user's requirements, incorporating established prompt engineering best practices.

## Prompt Engineering Instructions

Follow these steps to create a high-quality prompt:

1. **Analyze Requirements**: Understand the specific task, purpose, and desired outcomes
2. **Apply Best Practices**: Incorporate proven prompt engineering principles
3. **Structure Effectively**: Organize content for maximum clarity and performance
4. **Optimize for Results**: Ensure the prompt will generate consistent, high-quality outputs

## Required Prompt Structure

Create your generated prompt with these (or similar) sections:

1. **Role Definition**: Define the specific role the AI should embody (e.g., "You are an expert software developer", "You are a professional editor")
2. **Context**: Provide background information and explain the overall mission
3. **Specific Instructions**: Detailed, step-by-step guidance using numbered lists for complex workflows
4. **Examples** (when appropriate): Include 1-3 concrete examples demonstrating the desired output format or behavior, ONLY if you think it will help
5. **Constraints & Requirements**: Specify limitations, requirements, or "do not" instructions
6. **Output Format**: Define the expected structure of the response when specific format is needed

Note: The previous sections represent guidelines and are not mandatory. Take into account task complexity, context, and user requirements, and tailor the sections and headings to optimize for the best resulting prompt. 

## Prompt Engineering Best Practices to Apply

- Use clear, unambiguous language that eliminates potential confusion
- Be specific about desired outputs with concrete details rather than vague requests
- Include relevant examples when they improve clarity and consistency of results
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for complex instructions to enhance readability
- Define domain-specific terminology if needed for proper understanding
- Include error handling phrases like "If you don't know X, say so" when appropriate
- Be explicit about context limitations to prevent overgeneralization
- Maintain appropriate tone and complexity for the target audience
- Structure the prompt logically from general context to specific instructions
- Keep it simple, and don't make it excessively long, be mindful of context length.
